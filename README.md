# AI - Artificial Intelligence
## What is AI?
AI is a set of technologies that **enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions**.  
(Ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations,...)


## Generative AI
A branch of AI that enables software applications to **generate new content**.  
Content can be: natural language dialogs, images, video, code, and other formats.   

### Language model
The ability to generate content is based on a **language model**, which has been **trained with huge volumes of data** - often documents from the Internet or other public sources of information.  
There are 2 types:  
1. **Large language models (LLMs)** - **very powerful** and generalize well, but can be **more costly** to train and use  
2. **Small language models (SLMs)** - tend to **work well** in scenarios that are more **focused on specific topic** areas, and usually **cost less**.

**Common uses** of generative AI include:  
chatbots and AI agents, creating new documents or other content, translation, summarizing, or explaining...

## Computer vision
Computer vision is accomplished by using **large numbers of images to train a model**.  

**Image classification** is a form of computer vision in which a model is:  
- trained with images that are **labeled** with the main subject of the image,  
- so that it can analyze **unlabeled images** and  
- identify/**predict the subject** of the image.

**Object detection** is a form of computer vision in which the model is trained to **identify** (draw a box around) the location of specific **objects in an image**.

**Semantic segmentation** is an advanced form of object detection where, *instead of drawing a box around the subject*, **the model can identify the individual pixels** in the image that belong to a particular object.

**Common uses** of computer vision include:  
key-word (tag) generation for photographs, visual search, monitoring stock levels or identifying items, security video monitoring, authentication through facial recognition, robotics and self-driving vehicles...

## 1. Machine learning (ML)
ML enables computers to learn from data and make predictions.   
ML is the subset of AI that focuses on **the development of algorithms and statistical models** that enable computer systems or machines to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so.  
Understanding mathematical concepts relevant to ML, such as *linear algebra, calculus, and probability*, is crucial for effectively designing and training ML models.

## 2. Deep learning (DL)
Deep Learning is a subset of ML that focuses on training **artificial neural networks (ANNs)** with multiple layers to learn from large volumes of data.  
These neural networks, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, are composed of **interconnected nodes** called **neurons**.  
The term **“deep”** refers to the **multiple layers** in these networks, allowing them to learn hierarchical representations of data.

Deep learning excels in tasks such as:  
| Task  | What is it | Tasks | Math | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| **Computer Vision**  | focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real world, similar to the way humans do.   |image classification, object detection, facial recognition, image segmentation...   |linear algebra, calculus, and image processing techniques    |
| **Natural language processing (NLP)**  |  focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way.   |text and speech, to extract insights, derive meaning, sentiment analysis, language translation, named entity recognition, text summarization, and question answering.    |  probability, statistics, and machine learning    |

## Machine vs deep learning
> **Deep** learning can **learn from its own errors** while **machine** learning needs a **human to intervene**.
------
## 4. Data science (DS) and analytics
Data analysis involves the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to uncover insights, patterns, and trends.  
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines various techniques and methods from statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.

## Data science vs Data Analytics
While both fields involve working with data to gain insights, **data science** often involves using data to build models that can **predict future outcomes**,  
while **data analytics** tends to focus more on **analyzing past** data to inform **decisions in the present**.
